CI-RBAC
=====================

A basic role-based access control library for CodeIgniter.


Installation & Setup
--------------------

... more documentation is required at a later date.

I've tried to keep things clean and descriptive so I hope the source itself
will be sufficient documentation for the time being. With any luck, you should
be able to drop the example folder into the right place on your web server and
see for yourself how it all works.

I welcome all constructive feedback, additions, fixes, etc.


Versioning
----------

Releases will be numbered with the follow format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor
* Bug fixes and misc changes bump the patch
